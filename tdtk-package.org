* Trauma director tool kit 

The goal of this org documant is to put the initial public release of
the trauma director tool kit (TDTK) into a basic org document for
later reference. The initial minimimal viable product release is done
with minimal functions designed for basic cleaniing and data
analysis. The main package and R files are located on a GitHub
repository:  (https://github.com/Eric43/tdtk.  These function can be
used alone or in conjunction with tdtk markdown and example R files to
help with patient analysis.  The funcitons currently comprize of:


-  age_cat() DONE
-  blind_tdtk() TODO was part of read_tdtk but seperating for ease of
   use.
-  ctr2cir() DONE
-  center2circle() DONE
-  disp_cat() DONE (basic) Dispensation cats derived from limited subset
- icd_cat() DONE (basic) ICD catagory based on text needs updating 
- iss_cat() DONE Used standard referenced ISS bins
- read_tdtk() DONE in testing for xls or csv.  Added xls
   functionality.
- route2center() TODO goal is to use zip or obscured addresses to
  overlay all of the "estimated" routes and plot alpha level/N as a
  way to find commonly traveled routes etc.
- zip_clean() DONE (basic) derived from a limited subset need to
  rewrite using regex and extract the necessary run of 5 0...9.



In addition to the tdtk-package a colletion of R functions, there are
markdown/R-markdown and later bookdown files for the development of
individualized dynamic documents (Refs).  The initial goal of the
markdown files is to provide a basic context to analyzie trauma
patient data.  These data analysis are broken into sections/chapters
currently sections are defined as:

- Data loading/cleaning
- Data summary standard summary stats analysis
- Scatterplots of county or regional data
- Geospatial analysis of patient distrubution
  + Trauma center service area in releationship to other centers
  + Individual data points with noise 
  + 2d density 

- Linear modeling for LOS 
  + With or without mortality
  + sub-grouped based upon standardized ISS catagories
  + Predicitive within historically established model
  + Can be used for Quality improvement for patients with longer LOS
    than expected.

- ARIMA
  + Modeling without sesonal correction.
  + Deconvolution of ARIMA data with sesonal effects
  + auto.arima() and prediction functions to look at expectation for
    patient numbers on a time sereis.

- Catagorization Modeling
  + Basic random forest model looking for morbidity/mortality
    catagorization.
  + Basic PCA looking a factor reduction in complex datasets
  + Later look at adding neural network model looking at
    procedures/timing of procedures as indicator of outcomes. (One ref
    on RNN (?) on diagnosis codes).

* Project needs/TODO list

** tdtk-package

This is the section of the todo lists on the tdtk-package.  This will
be used for tracking needs and what id done.

*** GitHub
    The GitHub tdtk public repo has been created and the functions have
    been "cleaned" of identifying/specific varible name calls
    (i.e. general calls of "patient_data" versus "<hospital name>_data".

**** TODO [#A] load and create the package using the package subdir.
     The goal of this is to have a seperate working package diretory
     in GitHub so that the subdir = "package" using the install_github
     in devtools. Done in Jan 2019 and then pulled/deleted because
     didn't change all varible names (ewo).  Recreate repo and load ASAP.

*** Functions

**** DONE [#C] Finish spell checking core functions
     This was done on 31Jan2019 for basic functions need to repeat on
     the DESCRIPTION and other entries.

**** DONE [#A] Seperate the read function into a less complicated mess
     Did the basic seperation need to develop blind and other
     ancillary functions

**** TODO [#A] Finish the tdtk_blind function
     This was included as part of the read_tdtk() and made it
     difficult to use and higher probability of
     errors/warnings/stops.  Therfore seperating the read and the
     blind functions. 
 
**** TODO [#A] Finish "compiling" the package 
     Due to the fact the laptop is does not have enough freespace for
     necessary devtools andsupporting programs the tdtk-package needs
     to be completed on "Rainbow candycane" (not my first choice of
     name).

**** TODO [#B] Look at package req.
     Finalize the necessary packages included determine minimum
     necessary instead of library(tidyverse) try to do the necessary
     subset of this library (i.e. instad of all of tidyverse for map
     function just use purrr or if plotting just use ggmap2....etc. ad
     nauseum).

*** Documentation
    The current tdtk-package is using roxygen2 package to generate the
    manual/documentation etc. 

**** TODO [#C] Read and edit the documentation
     Once I finish with my edits send to sdm for a fresh set of eyes.
     Plus he can deconvolute my wriitng.

**** TODO [#C] Get the necessary references/cross-refs
     The documentation usng roxygen2 need to add the necessary laTeX
     references and link to the necessary 

**** TODO [#C] Check on the DESCRIPTION file
     Its either the desc or aother file but need to see if I'm
     correctly referencing the necesary packages.  I was on the ggmap
     GitHub site and didnt' have similar calls as they did for the
     required libraries. 

**** TODO [#C] See if I need to add a seperate .LICENSE file  
     Using GPL-v3 for license.  I think that only the MIT licensed
     needs to be added seperate and GitHub seems to have the GPLv3
     text added to the tdtk repo.

*** Data
    The current dataset for tdtk is limited and not validiated.  This
    needs to be changed to allow for testing and necessary background
    for trauma professionals to use during data analysis.

**** TODO [#A] ICD look uptable (CT)
     Currently only using a set of unique ICD text descriptions based
     upon a small sample size.  Need to full dataset.

**** TODO [#A] Trauma Center data set (CT)
     Collecting the national ACS and state trauma centers in a
     standard .csv or .xls document to be included in the DATASET to
     allow for testing and analysis by end users.

**** DONE [#C] Testing .csv of WV and SE regions TC
     Waiting for the necessary trauma center names etc was taking too
     long so did quick sample of the ACS and some state datasets. WV
     was used due to the fact its a full ACS state with level I
     through III centers with enough eperation to help troublshoot the
     circle functions.

**** TODO Reference table upload(CT) 
     Need to maintain the necessary references to aid in the
     development and authorship of the tdtk.  Currently waiting on
     anyform of reference manager (see references section).  Suggested
     JabRef for cross platform but anything that can be exported into
     similar or org.ref are needed.



*** References

    
**** TODO Get any and all references from clinical team
     Need to get the references from the clinical team and use for
     necessay references to the functions and papers.
