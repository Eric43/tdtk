# Trauma Director Tool Kit (tdtk)
Trauma director tool kit repository
# Description
The trauma director tool kit is a collection of files and packages designed to allow trauma professionals to analyze, blind and graphically display pertinant clinical information.  Where possible the ACS care of the critially injured patient criteria are used:

The tdtk is not designed to supplant ACS' excellent work with NTDB or Quality Improvement Programs (QIP) but meant to help trauma directors with a eye to rural/poorly resourced trauma system report analysis.  See Chapter 15 in ACS care of the critically injured patient:

>"A trauma registry can be valuable only if the data it contains can be transformed into useful information through the process of report writing. Trauma registry reports support decision making and guide the management of the trauma center. Most trauma registry software provides for the generation of several standard reports that summarize different ways to address specific questions or areas of concern. Most standard reports are oriented to anticipate the needs of a trauma centerâ€™s PIPS program and provide the needed information. This capability should be built into the software itself or achieved by exporting the data to a separate spreadsheet, relational database, or statistical program."

# Installation

To install the tdtk package use the devtools install_github() using the "package" directory for subdir.  For example:

```{r}
library(devtools)
install_github("Eric43/tdtk", subdir = "package")
```

This is a basic devtool install and once the tdtk-package progress past prototype and into full version the goal is to move a stable version to CRAN and deveolpers version on Github or equivelent.  

# Project Organization

The tdtk project is designed to be fully free and open devlopment in keeping with this mission, the directory structure is divided into three parts.  First, there is the package subdirectory.  In this subdir is the necessary componets to install the current development version of the tdtk-package.r.  Next there is the ./source directory that contains the code used to generate the tdtk-package (with Roxygen2 document information).  

# Project Goals

The goal of this project is to provide trauma directors with the necesary statistical/mathematical models to analyze trauma patient data that has a basic Protected Health Informtion (PHI) removed but may still have a greather than very-low probability of patient ID (limited dataset).  With the limited dataset, a trauma director or apprpriate medical proffessional can generate necessary reports/figures.  

In addtion to the basic removal of PHI in the limited dataset (not intended for direct public use/viewing), ithe trauma director or apprpriatedly trained personell can blind age and zip to decrease potential risk or re-identificaiton to very low.  This blining option can bin ages, zip codes (removal of last 2 or full removal) or both(recommended for non-professionals).  To prevent further patient ID, the geocoded plots include random noise or will use mathmatical modeling via 2d statistical density models that minimize potential patient identification.

In conclusion, the tdtk-package is designed to be used by anyone in the medical profession that needs: basic summary statistics, scatter plots, geospatial modeling, ARIMA/timeseries modeling and others.  It is hoped that as/if this project is utilized that it can aid all medical professionals accross the globe independant of the resources availible to the practicioner.  When combined with free Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems like LibreHealth that multi-instutional, multi/transcultural blinded database. This database can be used for a range of advanced projects like machine-learning/AI models that once developed have no need for propritary software/hardware.
