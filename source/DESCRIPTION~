Description: This package is a collection of functions for the analysis of
trauma patient data currently from excel or csv but potential for EHR SQL
interaction is possible in future versions.  This initial set of functions are
meant to form a basic framework to analyze patient data that is cleaned of
direct identifiers and be used for physician to analyze.  In addition, certain
functions are designed to add blinding characters to zip code or set age bins
broad to allow for public distribution and removal of ancillary identifying
information.  0.1.x.. was used as alpha development in R for figure and Rmd
file generation.  The necessary functions for cleaning, extracting, displaying
the data and circle on maps were checked for functionality on R 3.5.2 and
combined to make version 0.2.0.2019 (major.minor.sub.year).  Version 0.2.0.2019
is a minimal viable product for initial use with markdown files.  When fully
developed (i.e all necessary functions for DRY (Don''t Repeat Yourself) version
1.0 will be released.
